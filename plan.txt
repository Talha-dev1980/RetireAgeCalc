you have made really good screens description. but i want to start 
with MVP and minimize the screen number and features. 
for that we must focus on retiremnet age calculator in which 
it is quite flexible that if a user enter the retirment age or not. 
if not then calculations make and tell the user how long user will
 need to invest and save for getting retired  this 
calculation will made baased on lumpsum investment and increase 
in investment percentage and also inflation.
if user enter the desired retiremnt age then calculate how much user should invest and gain incremnt rate 
to get retireed at the desrired age.
these screens after welcom screen must be shown as walkthrough minimal design to make it really user 
friendly and not so much stuff like they are in cocpit and have so much controls. lol
